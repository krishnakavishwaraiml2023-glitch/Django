This project is a Sentiment Analysis Web Application built using the Django web framework. It allows users to input text (such as reviews, tweets, or general comments) and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine the sentiment behind the text â€” whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
